# Bioinformatics-Paper
In the summer of 2020, I had an opportunity to take computer classes that focused on hands-on
experiences. These classes had projects based on solving real life problems. I felt it was very
useful because and I had an opportunity to work on real time data on endangered juvenile sea
turtles (L. Kempii) from a nesting site in Florida and determine whether they were related to
those in Mexico using genetics and programming languages. I had an opportunity to use the
program UGENE, a computer bioinformatics software that was built using C++. It helps to
analyze biological datasets (such as sequences, annotations, multiple alignments, phylogenetic
and trees).The built-in algorithm helped in identifying if the group of turtles travelled to Mexico
and laid eggs there.
I was able to use cs and biology (bioinformatics) to understand the genetic makeup of
populations. Bioinformatics allows researchers to compare the similarity of populations and
levels of cross-population mating.
